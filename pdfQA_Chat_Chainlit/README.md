# PDF Question & Answering

This folder is showing how to:

- Ask a user for a PDF file
- Chunk that file and create embeddings
- Store those embeddings on Chromadb
- Answer questions from users as well as showing the sources used to answer.

To run the example, download all source run: chainlit run app.py -w
Note: PLEASE install pip base on requirement.txt and fill in the ev.env because we use the Azure OpenAI
