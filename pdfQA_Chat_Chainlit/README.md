# PDF Question & Answering

This folder is showing how to:

- Ask a user for a PDF file
- Chunk that file and create embeddings
- Store those embeddings on Pinecone
- Answer questions from users as well as showing the sources used to answer.

To run the example, follow the instructions of the [main readme](/README.md).
